This has been almost always problematic.

- Earlier, Xamarin.iOS binding (VS v16.9) build was not possible, and the workaround was:

Close all the VS instances
Go to your VS installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\<Version>\)
Then go to MSBuild\Xamarin\iOS
Edit the file Xamarin.iOS.ObjCBinding.CSharp.After.props
Remove the following line from it an save: <Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Messaging.Build.targets" Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Messaging.Build.targets') And '$(MessagingBuildTargetsImported)' != 'true'" />
Open VS and try again

- For VS2022 v17.7.5, Xamarin.iOS binding build ends up with:
1>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Xamarin\iOS\Xamarin.Shared.targets(1628,3): warning : It's currently not supported to build a binding project from Windows unless a connection to a Mac is available.
Although the PC is connected to MAC :)
The above workaround is not working any more and I couldn't find a workaround yet.

For now I will build it on macOS and copy/use DLL instead of the project.

- For VS2022 v17.7.5, MAUI.iOS binding build also fails, and the workaround is to remove SessionId field:

# 10 Feb 24 - V2.0.0 HAS BEEN RELEASED
This release brings major upgrades with breaking changes, including platform and tool changes. For further details and the project's history, please refer to the previous [README](https://github.com/melihercan/WebRTCme/blob/master/README_V1.md). 

Added: 
- .NET MAUI 
- .NET 8 

Dropped: 
- Xamarin 
- .NET 5, 6, and 7 

The Xamarin code has been left in the repo but excluded from the solution file. 

Special thanks and credits to [GÃ¸ran Yri](https://github.com/EagleDelux) for his major contributions to .NET MAUI porting. 

Currently, MediaSoup is only working with Blazor. There are issues on both Android and iOS that I hope to fix soon.
